#Data Analysis in Football


This is my first attempt at data analysis and visualisation, so my code is very messy and clumsy. I'm figuring out new types of visualisations I can create with the free data that Statsbomb provide.
This repository will hopefully evolve into something better, more indepth and readable.

Thx.
